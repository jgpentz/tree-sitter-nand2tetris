# 🎄 Tree-sitter Parsers for Nand2Tetris 🎄

The goal of this project is to use the
[tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) parse generator
tool to provide syntax highlighting for the .hdl and .asm files used in the 
[Nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) MOOC.  Tree-sitter generates a 
general purpose parser based on a grammar, and in my case I used the parser
with the [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) tree-sitter plugin.
